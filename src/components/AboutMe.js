      <p>
        As a junior web developer based in beautiful British Columbia, I bring a
        unique background in Biochemistry, having graduated from The University
        of British Columbia. After gaining experience in healthcare, I made the
        exciting decision to pivot my career towards software development, and I
        couldn't be more thrilled about this journey. Living in BC allows me to
        enjoy stunning nature daily, which fuels my passion for exploration. I
        love going on hikes with my Australian Shepherd, hitting the slopes for
        snowboarding, and savoring every moment with a cup of coffee. With a
        strong foundation in science and a newfound passion for coding, I am
        eager to contribute my skills and creativity to innovative projects. I
        am actively seeking opportunities to join a dynamic team and make a
        meaningful impact in the software development world. Let's build the
        future together â€“ I'm ready to bring my dedication, problem-solving
        mindset, and adaptability to your company's success.
